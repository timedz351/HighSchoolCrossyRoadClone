# HighSchoolCrossyRoadClone

My second game made in high school. This was the second semster since I wrote my first code.

# WARNING
The code is messy and written in SLOVAK so beware! Don't ask me why I was very new to coding.

## About
A Crossy Road clone made using tkinter and pygame Python packages.
Everything was done by me except the splash animation.. and music.
